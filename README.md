# PPP Loans Analysis-Portfolio-Project2
The aim of this project is to analyze the distribution of PPP(Paycheck Protection Programme) Loans to small businesses. The focus will be placed on Amount approved, Lenders and Amount(%) approved by sector.

In this project, data was accessed through U.S Small Business Administration - apart of their covid-19 relief assistance to small businesses, they offered the PPP(Paycheck Protection Program), which is a loan they gave out to small businesses to help them pay their workforce. They made some CSV files related to the program which were imported into SQL Server Database. That data was cleaned and made ready to be used for analytics. Lastly, the imported data was explored with SQL for insights.
